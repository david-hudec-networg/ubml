/**
 * Import command for UBML CLI.
 *
 * Turns a meeting transcript into the text a source points at. The conversion
 * is trivial; the counting is not. Teams writes one long utterance as a run of
 * cues and closes the speaker tag only on the last of them, so a parser that
 * looks for complete open-close pairs keeps the final fragment of every run and
 * silently drops the rest. That happened: 990 cues in, 379 out, and an hour of
 * discussion came out looking like a corrupt recording rather than a broken
 * conversion.
 *
 * So every cue in the file must appear in the output, and the command refuses
 * rather than writing a transcript that is quietly missing two thirds of what
 * was said. Everything downstream trusts this file - a quote is checked against
 * it and `walk context` reads the surrounding turns out of it - so a lossy
 * conversion makes both of them lie.
 *

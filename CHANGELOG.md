Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

Initial development. Schema structure and core concepts are stabilizing.

See `/plan/README.md` for the roadmap and `/plan/00-design-decisions.md` for open design questions.

### Fixed

- **`ubml add` scaffolded a document that `ubml validate` rejects, for 13 of the 13 document types it can create.** `transformTemplateData` hardcoded `properties: []` for every section, so `TEMPLATE_DATA` carried no property information at all. The scaffolder then wrote an item key with an empty body — `TM01000:` with nothing under it parses as `null`, not an object — and validation failed on a file the tool had just produced. Types that appeared to work did so only because `items.ts` carried a hand-written example for them. Section properties are now extracted from the schema, resolving `$ref` into `types/`, so the scaffold satisfies the schema it was generated from.
- Sequence-typed sections (`links`, glossary `categories`) were scaffolded as ID-keyed maps. They now scaffold as an empty list with the item shape shown in comments, because a sample item would carry references to IDs the user has not created yet.
- Reference placeholders were always `AC#####` regardless of what the field accepts, so a scaffolded step link failed its own pattern check. The prefix now comes from the referenced definition's own pattern.
- Required array and object properties were filled with the string `TODO`, which is a type error the moment it is written.
- Section ID prefixes were read with a two-letter regex, so `roiAnalyses` (`ROI#####`) was scaffolded as `RO#####`.
- `ubml add hypotheses` wrote `root` and `children` as `{id, text, …}` objects and arrays; the schema wants `HY#####`-keyed maps. The scaffold was teaching a shape its own bundled validator refuses.
- `ubml add process` wrote an `id` property inside the process. The ID is the key and `Process` declares no `id`, so `additionalProperties: false` rejected it.
- Removed `templateDefaults.entities.type` from the entities schema. `Entity` has no `type` property and sets `additionalProperties: false`, so the default made every scaffolded entities document invalid.
- **`ubml nextid` could not be trusted as a source of truth, three ways.** It wrote its own answer back to the cache, so asking twice gave two answers and the number climbed on every call. `writeIdStats` only ever kept the larger of the cached and supplied value, so `syncids` could not lower a stale entry, which is the one case it exists for. And `minStart` was applied even when IDs already existed, so a workspace numbered from 1 was told its next actor was `AC01000`, leaving a 989-wide hole and two disjoint ranges in one document. A query no longer mutates the cache, a scan replaces rather than merges, and the floor applies only to a workspace with no IDs yet.
- `ubml nextid` printed `Highest:` from the cache while presenting it as fact. It now names the cache as its source and points at `ubml syncids`.

### Added

- **`ubml walk`** — bookkeeping for a stakeholder review of extracted insights. `walk next` shows the next `proposed` insight in the order the material was produced, with the source text beside the claim and a position counter; `walk set <id> <status>` records the answer. Deliberately stops at bookkeeping: reading a reviewer's reply, judging an ambiguous answer, or noticing that a correction changed the meaning is the caller's, not the CLI's. `set` rewrites one line rather than reserialising, because a workspace is a document a human is reading and its comments and quoting are content.
- `derivedFrom` on `valueStreams` and `capabilities`. Every other element type could cite the insights behind it; strategy could not, so a strategy document's provenance was prose the validator never saw. It is now checked like anywhere else.
- `tests/integration/cli-add-validates.test.ts` — asserts that every type `ubml add` can create produces a document `ubml validate` accepts. All 13 cases fail against the previous behaviour.
### Added

- **`reviewStatus` on every element that can carry `derivedFrom`** (`proposed` | `accepted` | `rejected`). `derivedFrom` proves an element came from evidence somebody confirmed; it says nothing about whether anyone agreed that evidence should become THIS element, with THIS name, merged with THAT one. A workspace whose modelling was argued over and one whose modelling was guessed looked identical. Extraction can now propose an element beside the insight that suggested it, and a reviewer approves the pair. Absence means not specified and nothing more, per P4.4. See DD-012.
- `ubml walk` drives the whole bundle: `walk next` shows the elements a claim proposes beside the claim itself, and `walk set` records either half - an insight takes `validated`/`disputed`, an element takes `accepted`/`rejected`, and the id says which is meant. Reviewing a claim without the element it would create approves the extraction and leaves the interpretation unasked.
- `ubml validate` reports how many model elements are still `proposed`, as a workspace hint rather than an error - a workspace mid-review is a legitimate state, it just should not be indistinguishable from a reviewed one.
- **`ubml validate` enforces what `file` on a source always meant.** It is documented as a path relative to the declaring document, and a real workspace had all five sources holding a SharePoint URL there instead - which validated cleanly and quietly meant no reader could check a quote against what was read. A URL in `file` is now an error naming `url` as the right field, and a `file` that resolves to nothing is an error too, because a dangling pointer looks like filed evidence and is not. A source with no `file` stays valid: a corridor conversation has no artifact. See DD-013, which amends P12.2 - the artifact stays out, the text an extraction read comes in.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- **`ubml validate <dir>` was silently skipping all schema validation.** The workspace-level validator ran each document's schema check but never attached a `filepath` to the resulting errors/warnings, and the file-result distribution step only keeps errors that have one — so every schema violation (missing required fields, invalid enum values, disallowed properties, bad patterns, etc.) was discarded for the whole workspace. Only cross-document reference errors and semantic warnings were ever reported. Single-file validation (`ubml validate <file>`) was unaffected. Now `ubml validate <dir>` reports schema errors correctly, attributed to the right file.
- `sources.participants` and `hypotheses` node `source` accepted a typed ID (`AC#####` / `SR#####`) *or* free text via `oneOf`, but any string shaped like a valid ID matched both branches, so ajv rejected it as "ambiguous" — the exact form shown in the `sources` schema's own example. Changed both to `anyOf`.
- Fixed the repo's own `example/` workspace, which the bug above had been silently letting through invalid: `example/actors.ubml.yaml` referenced a non-existent skill ID (`SK003` instead of `SK00003`).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **Knowledge layer**: two new document types for capturing where information comes from and what was learned from it.
  - `sources` (`*.sources.ubml.yaml`) — catalog of knowledge sources: interviews, meetings, workshops, documents, emails, surveys, observations, system exports, research.
  - `insights` (`*.insights.ubml.yaml`) — atomic derived knowledge (pain, opportunity, process-fact, stakeholder, decision, risk, assumption, constraint) that stays understandable in isolation, with an `IN#####` ID and a `SR#####` ID for sources.
  - New `derivedFrom` reference field on actors and hypothesis nodes, linking model elements back to the insights that justified them.
  - Hypothesis `source` field now accepts a typed `SourceRef` (`SR#####`) in addition to free text.
  - `ubml init`, `ubml add`, and `ubml help` all support the two new document types (init now scaffolds a sample `insights.ubml.yaml`).
- `ubml` CLI now checks once a day for newer releases and prints an update notice.
- `ubml validate` now warns (`SKIPPED_FILE`) about `*.ubml.yaml` files that don't match any recognized document-type naming pattern, instead of silently ignoring them.
- More validation error hints for properties placed on the wrong document type (`owner`, `properties`, `goal`, `objective`, `target`).
- New docs: `docs/WORKSPACE-SEMANTICS.md`, `docs/CONSUMERS.md`, and a `docs/projections/` guide covering BPMN, UML, ArchiMate, BMM, DMN/CMMN, Mermaid, PlantUML, VSM and other export targets.

### Changed

- Schema version bumped to **1.4** — all schema `$id`s and the `ubml:` document version now point at `/schemas/1.4/...`.
- **Breaking (scenarios schema):** renamed `evidence` → `observations` (and the `Evidence` type → `Observation`) in `*.scenarios.ubml.yaml` for consistency with the knowledge layer's terminology. Existing scenario files using `evidence:` need to rename the field to `observations:`.

### Fixed

- `ubml init` scaffolds `.vscode/settings.json` with `yaml.schemas` pointing at the current schema version for every known document type. The previously published `1.3.0` build predated the knowledge layer, so its `.vscode/settings.json` was missing `insights`/`sources` entries entirely ([#34](https://github.com/TALXIS/ubml/issues/34)).
- Fixed CLI command execution to use the correct distribution path after global install.
- CI/publish pipeline reliability fixes (dependency cache cleanup, explicit build step before `npm publish`).
